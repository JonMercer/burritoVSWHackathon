# burritoVSWHackathon

Traditional banner ads have become smarter by showing more relevant content, however, our brains have quickly learnt how to filter out the ads. On the other hand, product giveaways are at low risk and low cost compared to full-blown marketing strategies for mom-n-pop shops. 

Burrito is here because we saw a need. A need to make giveaways fun through gamification. Our product aims to empower local businesses by providing an affordable and unintrusive advertisement platform. We are taking the concept of “giveaway” and breaking it down to its simplest parts: a business and its customers.
